Analyzing the generating power of wind turbines

For my recent project, I delved into a dataset that focused on solar wind, particularly the performance of a wind turbine. The dataset included important factors like date/time, active power, wind speed, theoretical power curve, and wind direction.

Objectives:
Understand how the wind turbine performs under different wind conditions.
Figure out if the wind speed, wind direction, and actual power output are connected.
Compare the real power output with what was expected from the theoretical power curve.

Tools used: 
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for working with the data and making graphs.
Data Analysis: Tried to understand what the dataset was telling us.
